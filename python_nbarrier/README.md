# Spatial representation with Python

In this presentation, I describe two Python librairies dedicated to data representation on maps:

- Basemap (https://matplotlib.org/basemap/), which is an extension of the standard plot library Matplotlib
- PyNgl (https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/), which uses the NCAR Graphic library
